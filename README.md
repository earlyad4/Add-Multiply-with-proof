# Add-Multiply-with-proof
A simple Tkinter-based Python app that generates two random numbers, lets you add or multiply them, and shows a step-by-step breakdown of the multiplication process for learning purposes.

This project is a beginner-friendly math tool built with Python and Tkinter.  
It generates two random two-digit numbers, lets you add or multiply them, and provides a detailed, step-by-step breakdown of the multiplication process.  

The goal is to make math more interactive and educational, especially for learners who want to *see the process* instead of just the final answer.

Instead of showing "12 Ã— 34 = 408", the program walks through the multiplication steps so learners understand how the answer is formed.
